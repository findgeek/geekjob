## About Us

* We started Deepnote to solve the most difficult data science problems. But in order to do that, we don't just need better algorithms, bigger datasets, and more computing power. We need powerful tools that help us to reason, experiment, and collaborate. These tools do not exist yet. We need to invent them first.  

## What you need to have

It's great if you have experience building things with TypeScript, Node, Kubernetes, Postgres, and Redis but it's fundamental that you have a good understanding of distributed systems and systems architecture and can make good decisions between requirements and complexity.

## What you will do

You'll be joining as one of the first Infrastructure Engineers in the company. Your responsibilities will range from developing services that handle workflows of thousands of users. You'll be scaling our K8s cluster and encountering challenges that haven't been solved before. You'll often find yourself working with the latest cutting-edge features of Docker and K8s and you'll have your say in the choice of technologies we use and the features we implement.

We like to keep our infrastructure elegant and simple, but there are many hard problems that make us experiment with lots of stuff. 

### Why it would be awesome to work with us

We believe in our mission and we know there's no better place for us to execute on it. Your impact will be visible from day one. You'll work with people who are smart and motivated, but also kind. We expect the same from you.

As a startup, we heavily optimize for the execution speed and learning. You don't need an approval to make a decision.

We are primarily based in the beautiful cities of Prague and San Francisco, strategically located near delicious ice cream shops.
