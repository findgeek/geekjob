## About Us

If you are looking to have an impact on the world, then read carefully because at Choco, we are moving mountains to transition the world’s food systems to become more sustainable. The food industry is an industry with essential problems, especially in food-supply-chain. We leverage technology to build the digital platform on which the global food trade will operate. We have the potential to reduce food prices, decrease food waste by 30%.

In 2018 we entered the market with our chat-based ordering app and had drastically changed the way businesses work and order with their suppliers. Our founders have helped build companies such as Zalando (IPO’d), Lazada (sold to Alibaba) and Foodora (sold to DeliveryHero). We recently raised one of the largest Series A funding rounds in European history. 

Technology is at the core of our work. We are product-minded builders, architects, coders, bug-hunters and designers. We deliver the needed change via our mobile and web apps using cutting-edge tools, modern engineering practices and always keeping software quality on our radar. Of course, it’s not only about working with top-notch tools but keep hiring excellent engineers too.

Join us in leading the world’s transition to sustainable food systems.

## What you will do

Here at Choco, we like to use the space shuttle as a metaphor for our engineering work. Now, you will join and help us bring the shuttle to the moon. Your main objective will be to build a platform that enables feature squads to autonomously develop, test, deploy and operate their stack in a secure and reliable way. You will do this by ensuring that our systems are stable, reliable, operations are visible, deployment pipelines are in place, and teams have the necessary environments and tooling to ship efficiently and fast. You will work together with DevOps engineers and backend developers in your team, while also interacting with product managers and developers from other squads.

* You will take ownership for the Infrastructure technical planning and roadmap, defining key projects and keeping your team on track.
* Work together with cross-functional feature teams. Educate and enable frontend, backend, mobile and QA engineering areas with infrastructure. 
* Ensure your team members are aligned, performant, fulfilled and continuously develop both technically and personally via One on Ones. 
* Drive and deliver complex long-term, large-scale, cross-team projects and contribute to technical strategy.
* Review code and occasionally contribute to the core code-base
* Actively take part in interviewing and hiring top engineers for your own and other teams
