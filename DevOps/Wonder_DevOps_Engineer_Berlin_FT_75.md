### Why it would be awesome to work with us

- Our work is technically challenging: we're using WebGL for rendering 3-dimensional rooms that expand when more users join. Now, we are starting to build our own WebRTC backend. It's incredibly challenging to enable real-time communication and data-flow between thousands of users.
- The future of work is a hot topic: remote communication will transform the way humans live and work. We want to become a core pillar of the online working stack. You'll tell your grandchildren that you were part of it.
- We have a world-class engineering team: we're a product-focused company and are assembling some of the smartest and and most talented developers and designers to build Wonder.
