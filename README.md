### How to submit new job?

To submit a new job, open an Issue. You can either use the Issue template `Job Posting` or create a new Issue and copy & paste the template from [HERE](ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md).  

Once submitted, the Issue is subjected to be reviewed within 7 days. Depends on the compliant level of the Issue, reviewer could ask for more information or reject the Issue. We will mostly use labels and comments for classification purposes.  

### Naming Convention  

Issue's Title MUST use this format  

```
[Company Name] - [Job Title] - [Location] - [Job Type]
```

Job Type should be one of the following:  

* FT (For full-time)
