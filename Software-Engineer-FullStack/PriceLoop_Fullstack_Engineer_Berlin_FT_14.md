## About Us

* Priceloop helps e-commerce and retail companies to be more successful by using data-driven pricing decisions. Pricing is one of the most important business challenges for our customers. At the same time, the market standard today is manual pricing or rule-based automation, which both are not truly data-driven. Our impact is huge -- our customers see revenue increases of up to 20%.

* Experience with the command line, shell scripting and version control (Git)
* Working experience with cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku)
* Experience with modern agile software development practices like test-driven development, pair programming, CI/CD etc. 
* Highly proficient in spoken and written English

## What you will do

- You will help to build the backbone of our cloud-based software (dashboard, login etc.)
- You will work closely with the data scientists and data engineers to operationalize the machine learning models
- You will take an active part in building up the new company
